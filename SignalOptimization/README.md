# üåÜ Setting Up Bangalore Networks üö•

Welcome to the Bangalore Networks setup guide! Here, you'll find everything you need to get started with simulating and analyzing traffic networks in the vibrant city of Bangalore. Buckle up and get ready to dive into the world of urban mobility simulations!

## üìÇ BangaloreNetworks Folder

The `BangaloreNetworks` folder is the heart of this project, containing simulation and network files for two key areas in Bangalore: Sarjapur and KSR. Explore these files to get a glimpse into the intricate traffic patterns of these bustling areas.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before we get started, you'll need to make sure you have SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) and its tools installed on your system. Follow these steps to get everything set up:

1. **Add SUMO's Stable Repository**

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:sumo/stable
sudo apt-get update
```

2. **Install SUMO and Its Tools**

```bash
sudo apt-get install sumo sumo-tools sumo-doc
```

3. **Set SUMO_HOME Variable**

The default installation path for SUMO is `/usr/share/sumo`. Set the `SUMO_HOME` variable by running:

```bash
echo 'export SUMO_HOME="/usr/share/sumo"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

4. **Improved Performance with Libsumo (Optional)**

For improved performance with Libsumo, declare the following variable:

```bash
export LIBSUMO_AS_TRACI=1
```

**Note:** Enabling this may restrict the use of `sumo-gui` and parallel simulations. For more details, check out the [Libsumo documentation](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Libsumo.html).

## üöÄ Installing SUMO-RL

You can install SUMO-RL, a powerful reinforcement learning library for SUMO, via pip:

**Stable Release Version:**

```bash
pip install sumo-rl
```

**Latest (Unreleased) Version from GitHub:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LucasAlegre/sumo-rl
cd sumo-rl
pip install -e .
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running RESCO Codes

To run the RESCO codes, you'll need to clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pi-Star-Lab/RESCO
```

Before running, execute `python setup.py install`.

## ü§ñ Running STD-MAE Codes

The STD-MAE codes depend on a separate repository hosted at https://github.com/Jimmy-7664/STD_MAE. Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jimmy-7664/STD_MAE
cd STD_MAE
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can now run the STD-MAE codes.

## üåü Contributing

# SUMO_TraCI
### This repository contains a Python Script, a SUMO configuration (.sumocfg) file and a zip file containing files generated in a sample run. 
On running the Python Script, you are asked to input any location name (better keep it specific like - New York City, Carnegie Mellon University, etc). This geographic location is converted into coordinates using geocoder library. Then using Selenium library, a map of the given location in .osm format is downloaded into your default downloads folder. This file is then moved into your working directory (for which you will have to change the variable 'destination' in the python script).\
After the map.osm file is moved to the working directory, the network from this map is extracted into .net.xml format. Using randomTrips.py, random routes are generated in the network. In the .sumocfg file, the network file, route file and output files are declared.\
Finally, in the Python Script, TraCI is used to simulate the .sumocfg file and the output is stored in .out.xml format file.\
For your convineance, all the files generated on a sample run are given in the zip file.
